## Project Overview :page_facing_up:



### Overview

Flow AI lets web3 protocol communities to easily deploy AI Agents to gather insights from their onchain and offchain data, with the goal to onboard new members and activate the existing ones.

Today new members can use Flow AI to learn Polkadot by finding, documentation, events, and hackathons. Today power users can use it to gather intelligence, run researches, and getting daily digests.

In the future Flow AI will introduce more features, such as write smart contracts and testing them, running transactions via intents, for example to run yield farming autonomously.


### Project Details

#### Architecture:

Our platform is built in python and react/remix on top of Kubernetes. We run AI-driven ETLs on Argo (AI creates the schema, takes care of dedup and other actions that require human decisions). We use a combination of LLMs (GPT4, Sonnet3.5, Gemini) and SLMs (GPT4o, Haiku3.5, Llama 7b). We implemented a SOTA RAG and fine tuned for web3 (bigquery + Qdrant). We also integrated web3 tools into the agents, such as Dune, Etherscan, TheGraph and more.

Our current ecosystem tools and integrations includes:
- Dapps
- Social channels: twitter, telegram, discord, discourse
- News and blog posts
- Knowledge: docs, wiki, youtube
- Events & hackathons: luma, partiful, and conferences
- Proposals

On top of that we also run integrations with web3 applications such as Etherscan, Dune Analytics, Coingecko, TheGraph, and we're actively adding more.

#### **Deliverables:**

| Number | Deliverable | Specification |
| -----: | ----------- | ------------- |
| **0a.** | License | GPLv3 (Only AI tools component) |
| **0b.** | Documentation | The AI Agent will answer any question about the documentation. |
| **0c.** | Testing and Testing Guide | AI agents and LLMs are non deterministic. Queries, calculations, and transactions are deterministic. To provide trust in the agent, the agent will always provide transparency on any deterministic answer to verify its correctness, and resources to the content .  |
| **0d.** | Docker | - |
| 0e. | Article | We will publish on social media and blogs about the Polkadot AI Agent  |
| 1. | Polkadot Flow AI | AI agent at polkadot.flowai.xyz to explore Polkadot ecosystem (onchain/offchain) |

## Future Plans
- **Short term plans:** We intend to use the grant to integrate Flow AI in the Polkadot ecosystem, to pay for the cost of running our ETLs for 1 year, and promote the product.
- **Long term plans:** We intend to enable Flow AI to execute transaction on chain via intents for example "here 100 DOT, find me a staking with the best yield", as well as talk and collaborate with other agents. Our goal is also to open source and decentralize Flow AI.
